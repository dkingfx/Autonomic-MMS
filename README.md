# Autonomic_MMS Control via Home Assistant
The goal of this project is to create a Python API to control Autonomic MMS eSeries using Home Assistant with Custom Component.

The MMS has a lot of features, I'm new to coding so i'm just trying to get basic playback and album art to display similar to how Volumio Media Player looks like.


Notes: I'm hoping the Russound RNET and Pymonoprice project can work for this API but it may need to be its own things with some similarities.
