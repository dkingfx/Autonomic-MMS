# Autonomic_MMS Python API for Home Assistant Control
The objective of this project is to develop a Python API that enables control of Autonomic MMS eSeries through Home Assistant with Custom Component integration. While the MMS has numerous features, I acknowledge that this undertaking may be challenging as I am new to Python coding. I am considering utilizing the Russound RNET and Pymonoprice projects as potential references, although the API may require its own unique implementation with some similarities.
