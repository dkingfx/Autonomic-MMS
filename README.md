# Autonomic_MMS Python API for Home Assistant Control
The goal of this project is to create a Python API to control Autonomic MMS eSeries using Home Assistant with Custom Component.

The MMS has a lot of features, I'm new to python coding so i know this is a big project to tacle as a beginer.


Notes: I'm hoping the Russound RNET and Pymonoprice project can work for this API but it may need to be its own things with some similarities.
